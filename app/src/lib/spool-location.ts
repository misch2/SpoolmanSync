/**
 * Spoolman `location` sync (issue: sync physical location into Spoolman).
 *
 * Spoolman has a native top-level `location` string field (max 64 chars). This
 * module keeps that field in step with where a spool physically is:
 *   - assigned to a real AMS/CFS tray  → "<Printer> - <AMS> Tray <N>" / "… - External"
 *   - assigned to a virtual printer    → the virtual printer's name (dry box/shelf)
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - OPT-IN. Everything here is a no-op unless the `sync_spoolman_location`
 *   setting is enabled, so existing users who manage locations manually are
 *   never touched until they turn it on.
 * - The write happens through an injected resolver on SpoolmanClient (mirroring
 *   the existing entityIdResolver), so every assign/unassign path — webhook
 *   auto-assign/clear and manual UI assign/unassign — inherits it from one place.
 * - Clearing on unassign is GUARDED: the client only wipes `location` if it still
 *   equals the label we would have set for the tray being left. A location a user
 *   changed by hand is left alone.

/**
 * Rewrite the `location` of assigned spools whose label went stale because the

 * at assignment time, so after a device rename every assigned spool kept its
 * old-name location until it was manually re-assigned (forum post 116).
 *
 * Safety model (a hand-set location must NEVER be rewritten):
 * - SpoolmanSync remembers the printer name it last wrote labels under, keyed
 *   by the rename-immune printer prefix. When the discovered name differs, the
 *   remembered name becomes a "former name", and ONLY locations that exactly
 *   equal `<former name> - <tray suffix>` for the spool's own tray are
 *   migrated. A user-typed location — even one shaped like a label — can't
 *   match a former name and is left alone, and once a former name's labels
 *   have all migrated it is forgotten, so even deliberately restoring an old
 *   label by hand sticks.
 * - The very first run for a printer (nothing remembered yet, i.e. upgrades)
 *   falls back once to shape matching: a location ending in the spool's own
 *   " - <tray suffix>" is treated as ours and migrated. This one-time pass is
 *   what heals renames that happened before this feature existed.
 * - Every write re-fetches the spool first and skips it if the assignment or
 *   location changed since the snapshot, so a concurrent webhook assign or
 *   unassign is never overwritten with a stale label.
 *
 * Virtual printers are excluded: their labels are bare names with no
 * recognizable shape, and virtual renames already migrate locations directly
 * in the virtual-printers route. Failures are per-spool and non-fatal (the
 * former name is kept for retry on the next load). Returns the number migrated.
